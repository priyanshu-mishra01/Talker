## Inspiration

I was inspired to build this chat app because I wanted to create something that people could actually use and interact with. As a young developer, I was motivated to learn and grow through building real-world projects, and this chat app was a great opportunity to do so.

## Special Thanks

I want to give a special thanks to my teachers and friends. Without their guidance and support, this chat app would not have been possible.
